# Search Agent Project

This project is a search agent developed based on materials from [UC Berkeley's AI course](http://ai.berkeley.edu/). It includes several search algorithms for Pacman and features for solving the Eight Puzzle.

The project was undertaken during the AI laboratory in the 3rd year of study, by Iobaj Andrei Sebastian and Moldovan Alexandru Cristian.

## Overview

The search agent project extends the capabilities of Pacman and provides solutions for the Eight Puzzle problem. It incorporates various search algorithms to enhance Pacman's decision-making abilities and solve complex puzzles efficiently.

## Features

- Implemented search algorithms for Pacman.
- Solutions for the Eight Puzzle problem.
- Documentation and materials for experimentation provided.

Feel free to explore the documentation and experiment with the provided materials!
